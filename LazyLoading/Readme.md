# LazyLoading
The loading attribute in HTML can be used to improve page performance by deferring the loading of certain elements until they are needed. One use case of the loading attribute is for lazy loading images.

When the page is loaded, the browser will only load the placeholder image. As the user scrolls down the page and the actual image comes into view, the browser will load the image and replace the placeholder with the actual image.
