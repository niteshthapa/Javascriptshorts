# structuredClone
Yes, the structuredClone method in JavaScript can be used to clone nested objects, including objects with nested properties or arrays.

As you can see,(see demo) the structuredClone method creates a new object with the same properties and values as the original object. The cloned object is a deep copy, which means that all the nested properties and values are also cloned.

Note that the structuredClone method is not supported in all browsers yet, so you may need to use a polyfill or a fallback method if you need to support older browsers.
