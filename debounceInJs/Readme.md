# debounce In Javascript
Debounce is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the main function will be executed only after user stop interaction 

By debouncing the function, we can prevent it from being called too frequently, which can improve the performance of the application.

You can change the delay time and check in demo.
